# Contributing to Devise

If you're looking at this file, then perhaps that means you're interested in 
contributing to Devise. If you are, thank you so much! If not, well... Maybe we
can change that.

Remember that, as stated in the README, this project has a Contributor Code of
Conduct, so read through it and keep it in mind as you participate. We want to
keep this as a safe space, so if you encounter any violations, shoot one of the
maintainers an email.

## Committing

The main thing to keep in mind when you're contributing is that you should use
the built-in commitizen adapter. When you've staged the files that you want to
commit, run

```shell
yarn cm
# Or,
npm run cm
```

That'll first lint all of the files in the project, then prompt you with the
`cz-emoji` commmitizen adapter. I thought it was fun, but we can change it
further down the line.
